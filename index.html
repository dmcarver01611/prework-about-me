      <p>I coach/compete in video game tournaments and play the drums and various other percussion instruments.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I met an old friend who works in this field when I was in between jobs and he told me abit about what he does and showed me the basics, and it sort of just clicked for me. The problem solving and freedom of the work environment really calls to me.</p>
